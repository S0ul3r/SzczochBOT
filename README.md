# SzczochBOT
Discord bot that posts accounts on command so far. More features will be developed later.

Discord is a free messaging app used mostly by gamers. There are a lot of bots already made for it, but this one is made by me. My bot uses the discord.py library which can be found here: http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/
